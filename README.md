# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

The perfect beginning of a magnificent e-commerce website, this repository contains all the back-end code you'll need to start your website off right. Of the MVC model, you're really only missing the V! There are full and functioning routes, models, and seeds to test run things. If you want to see more of what this application can do for you, I'd suggest checking out [the video I made!](#tests)

## Installation

Because this application does not have a frontend, installing it is not so straightforward. You're welcome to fork this repository and see how it operates on your computer. You'll need access to VS Code (or something similar), and you'll need to run a few items in your terminal before you can begin--such as 'npm i', and installing several packages--sequelize, mysql2, and dotenv. Don't forget, you'll need a username and password to use mysql and you can't use mine, it's a secret.

## Usage

This application has a CLI (command line interface), so it is all done through your terminal, and since there is no frontend, you'll need to use Insomnia (or something similiar) in order to test the routes.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, that's wonderful. You can fork it to your heart's content!
